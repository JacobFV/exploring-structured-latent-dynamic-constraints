# Exploring Structured Latent Dynamic Constraints ðŸ”¬

A HuggingFace Space for analyzing and finetuning transformer models with structured latent dynamic constraints.

## Overview

This space provides tools and interfaces for:
- **Model Analysis**: Explore the internal structure and behavior of transformer models
- **Finetuning**: Train models with novel optimization techniques and constraint mechanisms
- **Research**: Investigate how structured constraints affect latent representations

## Technical Approach

The project explores how structured constraints in the latent space can improve model performance, stability, and generalization. This includes:

- **Dynamic Constraints**: Time-varying constraints that adapt during training
- **Latent Structure**: Understanding and controlling internal representations
- **Optimization**: Novel optimizers like MUON for better convergence

## Getting Started

This is an interactive research space. Use the tabs above to:
1. **Model Analysis**: Run analysis on transformer architectures
2. **Finetuning**: Experiment with different training configurations

## Research Context

This work builds on recent advances in:
- Understanding transformer internals
- Novel optimization methods
- Structured prediction and constraints
- Latent space geometry

For more details, see the research papers and implementations in the `playground/` directory.
